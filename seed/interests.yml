# acani Interests in [YAML format][1]
# ===================================
#
#
# Summary
# -------
#
# This file contains a taxonomy of interests, arranged in hierarchecal
# structure, that acani users can join.
#
# When a user joins an interest, she also becomes a member of all ancestors of
# that interest. So, if Sue joins roller hockey, then she also becomes a member
# of hockey and a member of sports.
#
# A user can search or browse other users by interest.
#
# ## Search
#
# A search bar allows the filtering of all interests in real time.
#
# ## Browse
#
# The hierarchecal structure of the interests facilitates browsing.
#
# A user selects an interest to see either its children (sub-interests) or the
# users who've joined that interest.
#
#
# Contributing
# ------------
#
# We can easily parse this file with Ruby (programming language) into a data
# structure (a nested hash) that the acani software can understand.
#
# The content of this file is more important than it's format, which we can
# change later, but if you're comfortable editing this file in this format and
# in a [text editor][2], please do so.
#
# Basically, there's three formatting rules:
#
# 1. Put a hyphen & space before each interest, except for acani (the root).
# 2. If an interest has children, then put a colon at the end, otherwise don't.
# 3. Indent each child interest exactly two spaces relative to it's parent.
#
# Lines like this one that start with # are called comments and are ignored.
